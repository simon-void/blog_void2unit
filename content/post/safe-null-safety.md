# Safe Null-Safety

Learning Kotlin changed the way I prefer to program.
Since then, it's a bit tedious to work in programming languages that don't offer null safety and sum types (sealed classes) in one way or another.
This is why I tend to get puzzled when I meet other developers (or their code) who clearly didn't come to the same conclusion.
Sometimes you hear sentences like "Nullability is overrated", sometimes it's code which is littered with the not-null assertion operator `!!`,
clearly only there to shut up the compiler.

So let's see how to restrict the unsoundness of Kotlin's null safety in order to harness the full power of nullability.

## Kotlin's unsound constructs


### platform types

Next to a non-nullable type `T` and a nullable type `T?` there is also the platform type `T!`. You can assign this type yourself,
instead it is assigned by Kotlin's type inference to any instance that is returned by Java code (at least those that haven't been
annotation with [certain nullability annotations](https://www.baeldung.com/kotlin/platform-types#java-annotations-supporting-nullability-check)).

The designers of Kotlin could have decided to make any

- `lateinit`/`Delegates.notNull()`
- not-null asserting code `x!!` (or in a slightly different forms `x ?: errror("x expected to not be null")`, `requireNotNull(x)`, `checkNotNull(x)`)

### how to handle nullable values
- argument to functions expecting a nullable value
- `if`, `when`, `?:` to handle case of null
- `if`, `when`, `try catch` are expressions and can help initialise non-nullable variables
- `?:` to provide a fallback value
- `filterNotNull()` to filter a list containing `List<T?>` to a `List<T>`

**definition of unsafe**
- ok to use if you verify that it's sound in a way the compiler can't
- use sparingly/controlled, in other words not littered throughout the code base

**benefits of sound(ish) null safety**
no surprises! ->
- the null becomes 100% intentional to denote the absence of an object on a domain level
- make the null useful e.g. as mark an object for immediate removal (`mapNotNull()`)
- no null checks needed -> shorter straight forward code
- invocation chains are no longer brittle

**But what about Lombok's @Builder annotation? There seems to be no in-build builder facility in Kotlin. Do we have to implement a Builder for each class manually?**

**TLDR:** No, we don't. Use optional parameters (=parameters with default arguments) in your Kotlin class and use named parameters when invoking it.

## Parse, don't validate

Let's look at it in the context of loading a json file. A json file can contain
arbitrary content, but our app certainly expects a certain structure. (This is related to *"Even a NoSQL database
has a schema, albeit an implicit one."*") So when this json file comes in we first have to ascertain that it's in the structure
the rest of the application is build around.

Any json file can always be transformed into a `Map<String, Any?>` where the values are either "primitive types" 
(a `String`, a `Boolean`, an `Int`, an `Float` or `null`) or an `Array` or `Map<String, Any?>` containing these types. 

*Validating* is the more straight forward of the two.
